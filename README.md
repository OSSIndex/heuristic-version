# heuristic-version
Utility classes that help parse and compare version strings

This is a flexible wrapper class that can take version strings of multiple styles and perform reasonable comparisons between them when possible. I will also be adapting the code to handle various version range styles.

The code is a bit of a hack at the moment, but will be cleaned up and improved as I run into different styles.
